### Functionality

Reads phone numbers and emails with inconsistent formatting from an external file.  Then sorts, formats (if needed), and writes them to an output file for phone numbers or an output file for emails.

### Tests

Seems to be able to extract all emails and phone numbers from files provided.  And properly sort, format (as needed), and write to proper output file.

Tests will be run automatically.
